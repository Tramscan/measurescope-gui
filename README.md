# measurescope-gui
code for measurescope project. Must have RXTX installed (dlls for 64 bit included) and grbl installed
So basically you need to install RXTX on your computer (good tutorial on here: https://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Java/)
and GRBL hasn't really been used yet in this one but will be later on once I test the arduino communication and start messing with gcode
